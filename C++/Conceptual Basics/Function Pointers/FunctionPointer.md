# Usuage of Function Pointer
 * Function pointer holds address of the function pointing to the code, unlike standard pointer which point to data.
 * They make callback mechanism easy as they point to the address of the function, once the call-flow passes to other control block.
 * Enhances the readability of the code
 * Helps run time execution and promotes polymorphism

# Function Pointer as an array
 * **return_type (*function_name[SIZE])(parameter_type)**
