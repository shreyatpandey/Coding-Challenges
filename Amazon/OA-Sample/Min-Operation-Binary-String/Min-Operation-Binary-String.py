def min_operations_to_reverse_binary_string(s):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of operations to reverse a binary string.

    You can perform an operation where you move any character to the end of the string.
    The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations to reverse the string.

    Args:
        s (str): The binary string (containing only '0' and '1').

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of operations required to reverse the string.

    Example:
        min_operations_to_reverse_binary_string("0110") == 1
        min_operations_to_reverse_binary_string("1001") == 1
        min_operations_to_reverse_binary_string("0011001") == 2
    """
    if not s:
        return 0  # Empty string is already reversed

    n = len(s)
    reversed_s = s[::-1]  # Efficiently reverse the string

    mismatches = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] != reversed_s[i]:
            mismatches += 1

    # The core logic is that the minimum operations is equal to the number of mismatches divided by 2 and rounded up.
    # Because each move can correct at most 2 mismatches.
    return (mismatches + 1) // 2
