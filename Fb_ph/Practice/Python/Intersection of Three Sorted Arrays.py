'''
Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, 
return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.
'''
'''
Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.
Example 2:

Input: arr1 = [197,418,523,876,1356], arr2 = [501,880,1593,1710,1870], arr3 = [521,682,1337,1395,1764]
Output: []

TC:- O(n) total length of input arrays
SC:- O(1)
