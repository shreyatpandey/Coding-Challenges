# Cache Design in Embedded Systems

## Hardware Design

1. **Cache Levels**:
   - **L1 Cache**: Small, fast, and located close to the CPU. Divided into instruction and data caches.
   - **L2 Cache**: Larger and slower than L1, shared between multiple cores in some systems.

2. **Cache Size**:
   - Determined based on the memory hierarchy and application requirements.
   - Typical sizes range from a few KB to several MB.

3. **Cache Line**:
   - Defines the smallest unit of data transfer between cache and main memory.
   - Typical sizes: 32, 64, or 128 bytes.

4. **Associativity**:
   - **Direct-Mapped Cache**: Each memory block maps to one cache line.
   - **Set-Associative Cache**: Memory blocks map to a set of cache lines.
   - **Fully Associative Cache**: Any memory block can map to any cache line.

5. **Replacement Policies**:
   - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replaces the least recently accessed cache line.
   - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Replaces the oldest cache line.
   - **Random**: Replaces a random cache line.

6. **Write Policies**:
   - **Write-Through**: Writes data to both cache and main memory.
   - **Write-Back**: Writes data to main memory only when evicted from the cache.

7. **Error Detection and Correction**:
   - Use ECC (Error-Correcting Code) or parity bits to ensure data integrity.

## Software Design

1. **Cache Controller**:
   - Manages cache operations such as read, write, and replacement.
   - Implements replacement and write policies.

2. **Cache Coherence**:
   - Ensures consistency between cache and main memory in multi-core systems.
   - Protocols: MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid), MOESI, etc.

3. **Cache Optimization**:
   - **Prefetching**: Predicts and loads data into the cache before it is accessed.
   - **Blocking**: Groups data into blocks to improve spatial locality.

4. **Cache Configuration**:
   - Configurable cache size, associativity, and line size for different applications.
   - Use software APIs or hardware registers for configuration.

5. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use counters to monitor cache hits, misses, and evictions.
   - Optimize based on profiling data.
