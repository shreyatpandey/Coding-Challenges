Q] How would distribute load over load balancers?
Ans:- There are couple of mechanisms to distribute load over n servers.
One of them is in Round-Robin manner, so that every server gets an opportunity to process the load.
Other one is using some sort of hashing like Consistent Hashing, where the load is distributed depending upon the server that
