'''
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Hint:-
-2**31 <= nums[i] <= 2**31 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i+1] for all valid i
'''
'''
Approach:- Binary Search 
TC:- O(log2(N))
SC:- O(1)

Solution is exactly similar as Find Peak Index in a Mountain Array

class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[m] < nums[m + 1]:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m
        return l
