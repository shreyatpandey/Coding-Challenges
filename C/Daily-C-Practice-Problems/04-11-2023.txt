Q1] What do you mean by , "Offset Loading", in assembly language?
Ans:- OFFSET would have translated to a segment selector (DS) and OFFSET, 
whereas OFFSET FLAT translates to an absolute address of the label LC0 relative to 0 (seeing as that's the base of the DS segment in flat mode), 
which the linker resolves after it is assembled

Q2] What is edi?
Ans:- EDI is used to hold the destination index, ESI holds the source index and EBX is used as a general purpose index register. 
ESI and EDI are used in string instructions as source and destination, but other instructions can use them as general indexing registers.
