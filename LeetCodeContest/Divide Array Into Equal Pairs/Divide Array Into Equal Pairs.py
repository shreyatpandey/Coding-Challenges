'''
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: 
There are 6 elements in nums, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.
If nums is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide nums into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.
 

Constraints:

nums.length == 2 * n
1 <= n <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 500
