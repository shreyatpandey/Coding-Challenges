Question-1:-
#include <iostream>
class C {
public:
  explicit C(int) {
    std::cout << "i";
  }
  C(double) {
    std::cout << "d";
  }
};

int main() {
  C c1(7);
  C c2 = 7;
}
//Output:- id
These are two examples of initialization. 
The first form, C c1(7), is called direct-initialization, t
he second, C c2 = 7, is called copy-initialization. 
In most cases they are equivalent, but in this example they are not, since the int constructor is explicit.
