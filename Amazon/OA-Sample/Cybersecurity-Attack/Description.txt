The virus designed has an attacking rule defined by the attackOrder, which is a permutation string of length n. 
In the ith second of the attack, the virus attacks at the attackOrder[i] the character of the password, replacing it with malicious character '*', i.e., password[attackOrder[i]] = '*' after the ith second

function to perform :- findMinimumTime with the following input parameter

[1] string password : the initial password

[2] int arrackOrder[n]:- permutation array of integers [1,2,..n], the attack order of the virus

[3] int m: the recoverability parameter

The password is said to become irrecoverable when the number of substrings of the password containing at least one malicious character '*' becomes greater than or equal to m.

Return: 

int : the minimum time after which the password becomes irrecoverable

// Sample Input:-

string password : "abc"

int attackOrder[n]: [1,2,3]

m: 1

Output :- 1

// Sample Input:

string password: "bcdb"

int arrackOrder[n]: [2,4,1,3] 

m:10

Output:- 4
