'''
Given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], 
return the minimum number of conference rooms required.
'''
'''
Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
'''
'''
Constraints:
1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
0 <= starti < endi <= 10^6
'''
'''
Complexity:-
TC:- O(nlog(n)) sorting start and end timings
SC:- O(n) this is used for two separate arrays for start_time and end_time

            if start_timings[start_pointer] >= end_timings[end_pointer]:
                # Free up a room and increment the end_pointer.
                used_rooms -= 1
                end_pointer += 1

            # We do this irrespective of whether a room frees up or not.
            # If a room got free, then this used_rooms += 1 wouldn't have any effect. used_rooms would
            # remain the same in that case. If no room was free, then this would increase used_rooms
            used_rooms += 1    
            start_pointer += 1   

        return used_rooms
