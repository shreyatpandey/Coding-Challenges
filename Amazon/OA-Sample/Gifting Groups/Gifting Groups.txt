At audible, a subscriber can gift an audiobook from his/her library to any other non-subscriber to kick start their audiobook journey. The first time
subscriber can receive up to a maximum of audiobooks from their friends/relatives. When a non-subscriber receives an audiobook, we can infer that 
the two may be related. Similarly, if the non-subscriber receives gifted books from two other subscribers, we can infer that all of them are related
and the three of them form a group. More formally, a group is composed of all of the people who know one another, whether directly or transitively.
Audible would like your help finding out the number  of such distincy groups from the input data.
