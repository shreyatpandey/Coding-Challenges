that customer
b. for customer which required testing in LTE and Wifi network , I pushed it by engaging QA and testing team
c. Kept an open communication channel by regular following-up with them with their demands and keeping a complete loop of

Story-2:- [Invented something/ Made improvement in your company]
1. Call-Flow Parser:- At Qualcomm, used Python and django framework to display call flow for our internal customers and testing team.

the call flow.

Story-3:- [Made Improvementst at your company]

Are Right, a Lot:-
Story-1:- [Used your judgement to solve a problem]
1. Jitter-rate:- In Qualcomm, used my judgement in networking domain from master's to increase the jitter rate over video call over VoIP.
Issue was faced by testing team. I checked the log and told them to configure higher jitter rate . Helped them save time and prevented from escalating to upper management.

Story-2:- [Insufficient information or incomplete data]
1. Sprint Planning at Microsoft:- There was one task that I was assigned to me regarding the integration of different agents with our service.
This task had to be completed in the up coming spring session. 
Task:- There was no clear terms that were defined in this task as what information had to be integrated in the service that I own. But still I had 
to complete before the next sprint deadline
Action:- I talked with different members of the agent team for whom we were the customer. Tried to get as much clarity from them. Yet the scope of
the project was somewhat unclear.
Result:- I tried to reason out how the flow of information had to take place, used my logic to absorb those information in my service and how
it can be done without causing minimal issue to other customers

Story-3:- [Time when you were wrong]
From Fb regarding deadlock issue in SLA, course correction and gained insight, live in future

Learn and be Curious:-
Story-1:- [Learned new technologies]
Ans:- Picked up front end technology :- javascript and Node.js even though I had been a system guy and no prior exposure to that.
Situation:- During my time at Microsoft, a situation aroused where I had to develop a user friendly tool to display virtual machine health
report to our customer. This was need of the hour cause, customer was not a techinical person and I had to make his work as easy as possible.
Task:- I had to quickly learn this front end technology and start working on it.
Action:- Given that it javascript and node.js is vast and there is high learning curve, I start to learning first specific modules which were
necessary for my project. I allocated 10% of my daily work to learn this and made progress incrementally.
Result- Within a period of one month, I start making a good desing for our UI tool and customer seemed extremely satsified with this new UI tool.

Story-2:- [Smarter Decision with the help of curiosity]
Situation:- There was a situation during my internship at Intel, where I had to make meaningful and useful visualization chart using the testing log.
Task:- My task was to parse those information which very relevant and benficial for the team.
Action:- I checked and extracted throughput and bandwidth of the LTE/ifi network. Then consequently tried to put this information into a moving
average graph.
Result:- With my curiosity to learn about this visualization technique, I took smart decision to implement moving average chart instead of 
static chart. I enhanced the productivity of my team by 30% as they would can track of the changes in these logs in real time.
