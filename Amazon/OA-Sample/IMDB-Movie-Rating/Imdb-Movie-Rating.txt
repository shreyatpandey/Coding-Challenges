IMDB, a subsidiary of Amazon, is a popular platform to find ratings on movies and TV shows.
Data analysts are exploring user preferences by analyzing sequeneces
of movie ratings. One metric they're interested in is the count of 
positions where each rating is followed by a higher rating. They want
to find the maximum possible value of this metric by rearranging the
ratings in the most optimal way.

Give array ratings of n integers, find the maximum possible number of indices i
such that ratings[i] < ratings[i+1] after rearranging the array optimally.

Example:
n = 3
ratings = [2,1,3]
output = 2
