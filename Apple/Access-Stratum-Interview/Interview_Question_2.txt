Q] What is LTE Qos / QCI for Supplementary Service? 5 [ bombed did not know this]
Q] If IMS pdn is up, does Supplementary Service still require its on-Demand PDN?

Memory-Layout:-
(1) What are different memory layout in C?
(2) How do you handle heap size allocation?
-> Gave details about memory leak
-> double free
-> using pointer which has been deleted

Operating-System:-
(1) How does thread communication happen in C?


Coding:-
(1) Write the definition of function pointer
(2) Debugging code:-
// Function to add extra space at the end
char* AddNewLineSpace(char* s)
{
  char buffer[1024];
  strcpy(buffer,s):
  buffer[strleng(s)-1] = '\n';
  return buffer
}
/* Correct Solution for this*/
char* newString(char* s)
{
    char* newBuffer = (char*)malloc(sizeof(s));
    if(s != NULL)
    {
        strncpy(newBuffer,s,strlen(s));
        newBuffer[strlen(s)] = '\n';
    }
    return newBuffer;
}

(3)Two-Sum in C
(4) Swap two bits in an integer
