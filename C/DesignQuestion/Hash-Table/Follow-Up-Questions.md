# Hash Table Implementation - Follow-Up Questions for Embedded Software Engineer Interview

## 1. Memory and Resource Constraints
- How would you modify your hash table implementation if you had very limited memory constraints?
- What strategies would you use to handle hash table resizing in a memory-constrained embedded system?
- How would you implement the hash table if dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free) was not allowed?

## 2. Collision Handling
- What are the trade-offs between different collision resolution strategies (chaining vs open addressing) in an embedded context?
- How would you modify your collision handling approach if stack space was very limited?
- Can you explain how you would implement collision resolution without using linked lists to save memory?

## 3. Performance and Optimization
- How would you optimize your hash function for embedded systems with limited processing power?
- What considerations would you make if this hash table needed to work in real-time systems with strict timing constraints?
- How would you measure and reduce the worst-case execution time of your hash table operations?

## 4. Reliability and Safety
- How would you make your hash table implementation thread-safe for a multi-threaded embedded system?
- What error handling mechanisms would you implement to make the hash table robust against hardware failures?
- How would you implement data integrity checks in your hash table?

## 5. Testing and Debugging
- How would you unit test this hash table implementation on an embedded platform?
- What debugging strategies would you use if the hash table was running on bare metal hardware?
- How would you validate that your hash table implementation doesn't cause memory leaks or buffer overflows?

## 6. Specific Embedded Considerations
- How would you modify your implementation to work with fixed-size memory pools instead of heap allocation?
- What considerations would you make if this hash table needed to persist across system reboots?
- How would you handle endianness issues if the hash table data needed to be shared between different processors?

## 7. Power Optimization
- How would you modify your implementation to be more power-efficient?
- What strategies would you use to minimize CPU cycles in your hash operations?

## 8. System Integration
- How would you integrate this hash table with an RTOS?
- How would you handle cases where the hash table needs to be accessed from both interrupt context and normal execution?
