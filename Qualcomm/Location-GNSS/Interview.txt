Q1] What is void pointer?
Q2] Can you perform pointer arithmetic on void pointer?
Q3] What is dangling pointer?
Q4] What is an advantage of defining pointer to Null?
Q5] Are pointers and array same?
Q6] 
int arr[10] = {0}
int *ptr = arr;
int *ptr1 = &arr;
Are ptr and ptr1 same?

Size of the two datatype
int arr[10]; //sizeof(arr) = 40
int *ptr; //sizeof(arr) = 4 

Output of this program
#define Square(n) n*n
int n = 5;
printf("%d\n %d\n",Square(n++),n);
First asked me what are the stage of compilation in C program?

error in this program
char *input = "Jeevan"; // part of read only text segment
input[2] = 'f' ; // error 
char Input[] = "Jev";
Input[1] = 'f' ; // this is possible


Q7] Program to find the number of set bits in an integer?
Q8] Program to perform circular shift of an integer?
Q9] Program to define 2D array in C?
Q10] Define a function pointer in C?

Q1] Program to reverse words in a sentence?
- Lot of edge cases
- first gave const char*input , found that out, I had done in-place,
- I asked if the string is null-terminated
main thing is don't assume anything
- asked for size of string
- More follow-up
number of spaces between words, I had assumed only a space between words
- Whether the words contain any numbers in it or not

Q2] Deadly:-
I have a stream of bytes coming in a string.
At a particular address there is a struct present, I would need to extract num from it.
struct Node
{
  int num;
};
Say this struct is present after a tag = 0x65
0x00 0x01 ...0x65...0x78
Bytes end in 0x78
